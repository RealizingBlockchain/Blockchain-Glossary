# Blockchain-Glossary

Distributed ledger terminology encompases a unique mix of topics, the basics of which are derived mostly from the financial and
technological (did I miss any) sectors, which detail some of the fundamental aspects and tools that make up this technology.
DLT terminology also includes terms that are derived from its use cases, such as from the supply chain, the sharing economy, the 
banking industry, trading, financial instruments, etc.

Standardization of the terms of any emerging solution serves as the basis of communication regarding its proper development and use,
so here's a blockchain glossary which we hope will be useful to everyone involved or interested in this wonderful and exciting technology.

To make this glossary more useful, we will ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `color code`  it (use this example to select a color code) to categorize technological, legal, financial and other terms.

Please feel free to refine, add, comment, or remove unnecessary terms, and if you copy terms from other sources, make sure to
note them, to give proper credits and to verify that you aren't breaking any licencing terms.
